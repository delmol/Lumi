# Lumi

Lumi is a proof of concept cryptocurrency built in Python.

The aim of this project is to produce a simple, fully functioning cryptocurrency for educational purposes that can be used to teach/understand how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin function. We also aim to make this project simple and lightweight, so that it can easily be extended by other developers looking to work on their own projects.
