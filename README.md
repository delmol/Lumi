# Lumi

Lumi is a proof of concept cryptocurrency built in Python.

The aim of this project is twofold:

1. To produce a simple, fully functioning cryptocurrency for educational purposes that can be used to teach/understand how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin function. We also aim to make this project simple and lightweight, so that it can easily be extended by other developers looking to work on their own projects.

2. To produce a proof of concept implementation of our custom "Proof of Consensus" alogorithm - which aims to be an efficient and security concious alternative to the traditional Proof of work and Proof of stake algorithms. This algorithm is very much a work in progress, further documentation and it's accompanying academic paper will be published in time.
